# WebGL-2D-Platformer

GDD V 1.0: 
  Early brainstorming for game, rough outline of the game mechanics with no full detail locked in yet for character/enemy designs, environment, seetting or obstacles.    Some ideas, concepts or game mechanics may still be added or altered later. 

The game is a simple 2D platformer where the player controls a blue space-man character.
The player is controlled using WASD or the arrow keys, with the space bar being used to jump.
The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level and collect a trophy awaiting the player. Along the way, the player will have to dodge multiple enemies and obstacles using the move and jump controls. The enemies are not killable, and will reset the you back to the checkpoint if they touch the player character.
